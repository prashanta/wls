It has six fundamental features:\r\n\r\n1. Multiple sort table\r\n2. Breadcrumb navigation\r\n3. Directory title via .comment file\r\n4. File comments via .comment file\r\n5. Summary of contents in a directory\r\n6. Filter list by file type\r\n\r\nThe size of entire package is under _300KB_.\r\n\r\nDemo: http://prashanta.me/wls\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n---\r\nCopy the contents of <b>wls</b> to the director that you want to have it managed. All the consequent sub folders will be managed. \r\n\r\nTo add directory title and file comments edit _.comment_ file on respective folder.\r\n\r\nYup, thats it.\r\n\t  \r\n### Which files are ignored?\r\n---\r\n- _index.php_\r\n- Any file/folder that begins with \".\"\r\n\r\n### 3rd Party\r\n---\r\n- __jQuery__: http://jquery.com/\r\n- __Tablesorter__: http://tablesorter.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n---\r\n\r\n__The MIT License__\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Prashanta Shrestha <hi@prashanta.me>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
