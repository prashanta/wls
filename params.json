Summary of contents in a directory\r\n6. Filter list by file type\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n----------------\r\nCopy the contents of <b>wls</b> to the director that you want to have it managed. All the consequent sub folders will be managed. Yup, thats it.\r\n\t  \r\n### Which files are ignored?\r\n----------------------------\r\n- index.php\r\n- Any file/folder that begins with \".\"\r\n\r\n### 3rd Party:\r\n----------------------------\r\n- jQuery: http://jquery.com/ \r\n- Tablesorter: http://tablesorter.com/\r\n\r\nDemo: http://prashanta.me/wls","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
