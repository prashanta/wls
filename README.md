### About

__wls__ is a minimalistic approach to directory listing. It has six fundamental features:

1. Multiple sort table
2. Breadcrumb navigation
3. Directory title via .comment file
4. File comments via .comment file
5. Summary of contents in a directory
6. Filter list by file type

The size of entire package is under _300KB_.

### Installation
---
Copy the contents of <b>wls</b> to the director that you want to have it managed. All the consequent sub folders will be managed. 

To add directory title and file comments edit _.comment_ file on respective folder.

Yup, thats it.
